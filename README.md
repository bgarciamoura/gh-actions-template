# GH Actions Template

This repo aims to be my personal template to create new repositories with predefined workflows.

The goal is keep this repo updated with new workflows when there's a need of that.


## Current Flows

```
~/.github/workflows/
│
├── auto-generate-pr.yml            # This workflow, as the name said, aims to create a new PR for a commit made to a feature/* branch
