# GH Actions Template

Thanks to be here!!!


The main goal of this repo is to keep all my github workflows in the same place and be a personal template to create new repositories.

## Current Flows

```
~/.github/workflows/
│
├── auto-generate-pr.yml            # This workflow, as the name said, aims to create a new PR for a commit made to a feature/* branch
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Auto PR

The main goal of this workflow is to automate the PR's creation for personal repos. 

Stop creating PR's manually, or commiting to just one branch, create as many branches as do you want and use this workflow to auto send them to the main branch.

*Advertising*<br>
Do not use this workflow for teams.
To do that you have to change the workflow, removing the auto merge option.

#### How to config

The first thing you'll have to do is to create a github actions token:

1. You have to access your github account, click on your photo on the right side of the screen and go to settings;
2. Once there, in the left panel scroll down until you find the **Developer settings** and click on;
3. In the new page, click on **Personal access tokens**, to expand the selection, and choose **Fine-grained tokens**;
4. Now, generate a new token with access to your repositories and **Read and Write** permissions;
5. Save this token in a safe place to use on your repositories;

With the token in hands, go to your desired repository and access the settings page of that repo.

1. In the settings page, on the left panel, access the **Secrets and variables** section to expand the list, under Security options and click on **Actions**;
2. On that page, you can create a new *Repository secret*, it will store the token that you have created in the previous step;
3. Click on **New repository secret**, put the name as 'TOKEN', all caps, and paste the token on the *Secret* section, then save and you're ready to go;
